# WeatherApp

Thank you so much for the opportunity to do this test. I tried to use UIKit and SwiftUI as per the requirement. Used combine for the API call. Did not spend much time on UI. Just tried my best to show the data as much as possible. 
Prepare some codes to make it testable but I did not have enough time to write some unit tests that I wanted.
